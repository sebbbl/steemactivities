# Steemactivities

### Introduction
Steem can be used to reward anything. Blog posts, video, music, open-source projects... and sports activities.

Steemactivities is a project that aims to reward users who exercise and log their sessions on the blockchain, using Steemit, Busy, eSteem...

### Project details
#### Which sports are concerned ?
Every sport is eligible for reward. Not only running. Actually, people can log any activity on a tracking app. We ask users to add to their posts a proof of activity, the best is a screenshot from their activity tracker. All posts are manually reviewed.

#### Who can be rewarded ?
Anyone sharing a sports activity summary can be rewarded. No need to be a confirmed athlete, the goal here is to encourage people to exercise.

#### How are users rewarded ?
People who share their activity are rewarded by upvoting their post. At this time, the number of participants to the program allow us to upvote them at 100% power. 

In the future, a scale could be put in place to reward people based on the provided effort. This could be an incentive for pushing one's limits.



### Current state of the project
Steemactivities is a few weeks old now, and rewards users who share their sports activities summaries using the #steemactivities tag. A discord bot monitors the #steemactivities tag activity, thus we don't miss a post.

The @steemactivities account currently has about 200 SP, and keeps looking for delegators.

#### How are the team members rewarded ?
At this time, team members get 100% upvotes on their posts, limited to 2 posts per day. This may evolve in the future, depending on the member count and the Steem Power available.

### Roadmap
#### Website creation
This summer, a website will be created, where people can create their post. We will post guidelines for being eligible for reward.

The website may call to Strava API for easy logging all relevant data. All entries will still be posted using the #steemactivities tag.

#### IOS / Android App
A mobile application is also considered. This one will firstly let user directly post on the blockchain, we are also thinking of a dedicated tracking app. This will depend on the availability of a mobile developer at this time.

#### Search for delegators / sponsors
Delegators first, as a high SP will be necessary to motivate members to join. Sponsors then, as we also plan to organize contests / incentive for our members. This part has already begun and will be continuous.
